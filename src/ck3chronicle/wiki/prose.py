"""Narrative prose for chronicle pages, written from each page's own facts.

    ck3chronicle prose saves --out prose                        # template, no model
    ck3chronicle prose saves --out prose --backend openai \\
        --url http://localhost:11434/v1 --model qwen3:14b       # any local server

The wiki is factual; this adds a paragraph on top of the record, never in place
of it. Three rules keep the paragraph honest:

* A model sees a **fact sheet**, the same facts the page shows and nothing
  else, and is told to use nothing else. A save has no motives, battles or
  personalities in it, so neither may the prose.
* Prose is stored with a **digest of the facts it was written from**. The build
  shows it only while the page still has exactly those facts: a new save that
  changes a ruler's page makes the old paragraph stale, and a stale paragraph is
  left out rather than allowed to contradict the table under it.
* Every number the prose uses must be in the fact sheet. A year the save never
  mentioned is the commonest invention, and the cheapest one to catch.

The model is not chosen yet (Ck-parser's PLAN.md Phase 7), so backends are pluggable:
``template`` writes deterministic sentences with no model at all, and
``openai`` speaks the OpenAI-compatible chat protocol over plain HTTP, which
Ollama, llama.cpp's server, LM Studio and vLLM all serve. No SDK is imported.

Prose is laid out like the portraits: one file per page under
``<out>/<chronicle>/<characters|titles>/<id>.json``, generated where a model
runs, folded in by ``ck3chronicle build --prose <out>``. Its published home is meant
to be beside the delivered images.

playthrough. You are given a JSON fact sheet. Write one to three paragraphs of plain, \
neutral prose in the style of an encyclopedia.

Rules:
- Use only the facts given. Do not invent events, motives, wars, personalities, \
relationships or geography. Do not judge a reign. If the facts are thin, write less.
- Copy dates exactly as written. Where a fact says a change happened "between" two \
dates, say so; never pick a date inside it.
- "how_gained" says how a title was gained, never how it was lost. "passed_to" says \
who held a title next, not how or why: never say a title was granted or given.
- "next_holder_recorded_from" means nobody is recorded holding the title between \
"until" and that date. Say so; never name a successor for those years.
- A "no_holder_recorded" entry in a succession is such a stretch. Say nobody is \
recorded then; never bridge it.
- "held_when_title_last_seen" gives the last save that shows the title, and the person \
still held it then. It says nothing about later, and nothing about a death.
- "other_titles_this_person_held" are titles this same person held outside this \
chronicle.
- A de jure liege is only a legal claim; whether a realm was independent is what \
"lieges" says, and nothing else.
- Use each person's "sex" for pronouns and for words such as son or daughter. \
Use the counts given; do not count for yourself.
- Names are given as they should appear. Do not translate, correct or respell them.
- No headings, no lists, no markdown. Output only the entry."""
