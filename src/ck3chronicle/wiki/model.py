"""One run's history, merged from every snapshot that covers it.

A save prunes dead characters and destroyed titles as a run goes on, so the
newest save is not a superset of the older ones (Ck-parser's PLAN.md §4). The wiki is
therefore built from the **union** of the snapshots, oldest first, exactly as
the graph loader merges them: later snapshots refine what earlier ones said and
never remove it.

Names are a known approximation. A save stores `first_name` as a localization
*key*, not display text, and marks diacritics with an underscore: `FranC_ois`
is François, `O_zgul` is Özgül. Decoding that properly needs the game's
localization files, which this project deliberately does not read, so
:func:`clean_name` only drops the marker rather than inventing a letter.
