"""The harvest queue, from the companion's side of the table.

    ck3chronicle queue ids MANIFEST --out ids/ [--role ever-holder]
    ck3chronicle queue collect MANIFEST --from harvested/ --to images/

`portraits.json` is the one queue (Ck-parser#27): every portrait the wiki links, which
save it must be captured in, the exact file name to deliver it under, and
whether it is here yet. The companion (`ck_portrait_generator`) does
not read it yet: it takes an id list per save and writes `<id>_<save date>.png`.
This bridges both ends until it does, so the queue works today:

``ids``
    one ``<save>.ids`` per save, the ids still missing from it, rulers first,
    in the one-id-per-line form the harvester's ``--ids-file`` takes. One save
    per file because a capture needs its save loaded, and loading is the slow
    step: one load, then every id alive in it. Give each save its **own**
    harvester ``--out``: its resume manifest keys on the character alone, so
    in a shared directory everyone captured in one save is skipped in the next.
``collect``
    copies the harvester's ``<id>_<save date>.png`` files to the names the
    wiki links, found in the queue by character and save date, ready to commit
    to wherever the site's delivered images live. Copies, never moves; never overwrites. Run it
    once per save's output directory.

MANIFEST may be a chronicle's ``portraits.json`` or the root one, which names
every chronicle's.
