"""Parents, siblings, spouses and children.

The save stores parentage **downward only**. A character's `family_data` lists
their `child`ren, their `spouse`s and their `former_spouses`, and never their
father or mother: verified by scanning all 281 916 characters of the 1364 save,
of which exactly none carry a `father` or `mother` key (Ck-parser's PLAN.md §10).

So parents are found by inverting: read every character's child list and note
who claimed whom. That cannot exit early the way a targeted lookup can, because
a parent may sit anywhere in any section — which is the whole cost of this
module, one full pass over the character sections, ~37 s on a 280 MB save.

It is worth paying. Inverting only within a lineage finds parents for 447 of
its 666 characters; inverting the whole save finds them for 590, and gives both
parents rather than one for 536 of those. The rest are founders, or have
parents the save has pruned.

Siblings come free with it: whenever a child list mentions someone wanted, the
whole list is kept, so half-siblings through either parent are included.
