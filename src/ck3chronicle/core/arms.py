"""Coat-of-arms definitions, and naming an arms image by what it looks like.

`coat_of_arms.coat_of_arms_manager_database` maps an arms id to the recipe the
game draws from: a pattern, some colours, and one or more emblems.

    {pattern=pattern_solid.dds, color1=red, color2=red, color3=white,
     colored_emblem={color1=white, color2=white, texture=ce_eagle.dds,
                     instance={scale=[0.9, 0.9]}}}

That recipe **is** the picture's identity, and it is the only thing that is.
The id is an index inside one save, and whether the arms are fixed or generated
cannot be told from the dynasty they belong to: of 60 dynasties carrying the
game's own named key and present in two playthroughs, 57 had *different*
artwork, while 55 of 60 numerically-keyed ones matched. CK3 generates arms for
anything the game files do not author, and nothing in the save says which is
which (Ck-parser's PLAN.md §11).

So an image is named after a digest of its recipe. Identical artwork gets one
name in every run and every chronicle and is harvested once; different artwork
gets different names. Nothing has to be classified, and the companion can skip
harvesting altogether and compose the arms from the recipe, which the manifest
carries for exactly that reason.
