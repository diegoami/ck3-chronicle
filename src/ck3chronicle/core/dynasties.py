"""Houses and dynasties, read out of a save.

A character carries a `dynasty_house` id. Houses live in
``dynasties.dynasty_house``; each names its parent dynasty, which lives in
``dynasties.dynasties`` and carries the `coat_of_arms_id`. Both sections are
large (49 891 houses and 48 099 dynasties in the 1364 save), so lookups are
targeted by id and streamed, never read whole.

Names are localization keys like `dynn_Strathearn` with an optional prefix key
like `dynnp_de`, so the same caveat as character names applies: this strips the
key prefix and nothing more (Ck-parser's PLAN.md §8). A dynasty that the game has
already localized carries a plain `localized_name` instead, and that is
preferred when it is there.

Verified on the 1364 save: of 48 099 dynasties, 45 689 have `coat_of_arms_id`,
41 128 a `name`, 2 210 a `localized_name`, 6 320 a `prefix`, and only 4 761 a
`key`. That `key` is the game's own identifier and is **not** a display name:
sometimes a number (`"2"`), sometimes a slug (`"welsh_ap_bleddri"`, `"bovisio"`),
so it is never shown. A **house**'s `key` is the opposite: `house_munso` is
exactly the name, and is the fallback for a house with no `name` of its own.

A house may carry its own `coat_of_arms_id`, and then that one wins; only a
house without one inherits its dynasty's.
