"""A save's characters, reduced to the fields this project reads, cached on disk.

A build reads the character sections of every save **five times over**: once for
the lineage's holders, once for the family inversion, once to promote the direct
line, once to name the relatives beyond it, and once more for a faith's founder.
Each is a pass over a 280 MB gamestate, and the inversion cannot even exit early
(Ck-parser's PLAN.md §10). That is where a build's minutes go, and it is paid again in
full every time, even for saves that have not changed since the last build.

So a save's characters are written once to a digest and read from there
afterwards. Measured on the 1364 save: **281 916 characters, 11 MB gzipped,
54 s to write and 2.1 s to read back.** Adding a save to a run now costs that
one save's pass instead of the whole run's.

What is stored is exactly what the wiki and the hand-off ask a character record
for, under one-letter keys because the file has 281 916 of them: name, birth,
sex, house, culture, faith, death and the `family_data` links. Nothing else in a
record is read anywhere in this project, and a digest that stored more would be
a second, slower copy of the save.

The digest is a **cache, not a format**: it is keyed by the save's fingerprint
and thrown away whenever `SCHEMA` changes, so it can never disagree with the
save it came from. Nothing reads a digest whose header does not match.
