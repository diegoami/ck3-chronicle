"""A ruler's realm at one snapshot: what they hold, and what is held under them.

The realm is the closure of the ruler's own titles over the de facto vassal
tree of one save (`TitleIndex.vassals`). It is computed per snapshot and only
per snapshot: a save says who each title's liege **is**, never who it has been,
so between two snapshots all that can be said is that something changed
between them (Ck-parser's PLAN.md §9). No realm is ever interpolated.

**Depth is vassal rank**, counted in *holders*, not in titles: 0 when the
ruler holds the title, 1 when a direct vassal does, 2 when a vassal's vassal
does, and so on. A duke's county held under his own duchy is still depth 1 --
the duchy and the county have the same holder, so no rank is crossed. The
title tree is deeper than the chain of people (a county sits under a duchy
under a kingdom), and conflating the two gave a wrong figure once
(Ck-parser#40): the 1358 realm has 1 004 counties at title depth 2-3 but 778 at vassal
rank 2 or more.

It sits in `core` beside `vassalage`, for the same reason: the wiki uses it
now and the graph add-on may later, and the graph never imports the wiki.
