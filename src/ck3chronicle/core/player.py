"""Who was being played, and what their wiki should be about.

A run's natural subject is the played character's **primary title**, which is
the first entry of their ``landed_data.domain``. That was checked across the
three sample saves and across a succession: all three give `e_germany`, the
player's empire, even though the ruler changed (Ck-parser's PLAN.md §9).

The played character's id is in the save's plaintext header, so finding the
title costs one scan of ``living`` and one of ``landed_titles``, not a full
read of the file.
