"""Who a title answered to, as stretches between snapshots.

A save says who a title's liege **is**; it never says who it has been. There is
no vassalage history to read, the way there is a holder history (Ck-parser's PLAN.md
§9). All we ever have are observations at the snapshot dates, so a change of
liege is only ever known to have happened *between* two of them.

This module collapses those observations into stretches that say so. It sits in
`core` rather than in the wiki because the graph add-on writes the same
stretches as edges, and it depends on the library's core, never on the wiki.
